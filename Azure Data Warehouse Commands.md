### 1. **Azure Data Warehouse Commands**

These commands are crucial for managing and optimizing your Azure Synapse Analytics environment.

-   **CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS)**
    
    -   **Purpose:** Creates a new table from the result set of a SELECT statement.
    -   **Syntax:**
        
        `CREATE TABLE [new_table_name] AS SELECT * FROM [source_table_name]` 
        
    -   **Explanation:** CTAS is one of the most important T-SQL commands in Azure Synapse Analytics, often used to create a copy of a table or materialize the results of a query into a new table for performance optimization.
-   **CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE**
    
    -   **Purpose:** Creates a table that references data stored outside of Azure Synapse Analytics.
    -   **Syntax:**

        
        `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE [external_table_name] ( [column_definitions] )
        WITH ( LOCATION = '[file_path]', DATA_SOURCE = [external_data_source], FILE_FORMAT = [file_format] )` 
        
    -   **Explanation:** Used to create a table that points to data in external storage, such as Azure Blob Storage, allowing you to query data without importing it into the data warehouse.
-   **ALTER TABLE**
    
    -   **Purpose:** Modifies the structure of an existing table.
    -   **Syntax:**
        
        `ALTER TABLE [table_name] ADD [column_name] [data_type]` 
        
    -   **Explanation:** You can add columns, modify existing ones, or manage partitioning schemes.
-   **DROP TABLE**
    
    -   **Purpose:** Deletes an existing table.
    -   **Syntax:**
        
        `DROP TABLE [table_name]` 
        
    -   **Explanation:** This command removes a table and its data from the data warehouse.
-   **TRUNCATE TABLE**
    
    -   **Purpose:** Removes all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions.
    -   **Syntax:**
        
        `TRUNCATE TABLE [table_name]` 
        
    -   **Explanation:** This is a fast way to empty a table without removing its structure.
-   **PAUSE/RESUME DATABASE**
    
    -   **Purpose:** Pauses or resumes compute operations on the data warehouse.
    -   **Syntax:**
        
        `ALTER DATABASE [database_name] SET PAUSE;
        ALTER DATABASE [database_name] SET RESUME;` 
        
    -   **Explanation:** Pausing the database stops compute resources, which can save costs. Resuming the database brings it back online.

### 2. **Built-in Stored Procedures**

Azure Synapse Analytics includes several built-in stored procedures for managing and optimizing your data warehouse.

-   **sp_monitor**
    
    -   **Purpose:** Provides a high-level overview of system activity.

        `EXEC sp_monitor;` 
        
    -   **Explanation:** This stored procedure displays statistics like CPU usage, I/O activity, and more.
-   **sp_rename**
    
    -   **Purpose:** Renames a database object.
    -   **Syntax:**
        
        `EXEC sp_rename '[old_name]', '[new_name]'` 
        
    -   **Explanation:** Useful for renaming tables, columns, or other objects.
-   **sp_help**
    
    -   **Purpose:** Returns information about a database object.
    -   **Syntax:**
         
        `EXEC sp_help [object_name];` 
        
    -   **Explanation:** Provides details such as the structure of a table or the definition of a stored procedure.
-   **sp_spaceused**
    
    -   **Purpose:** Displays the amount of space used by the database or database objects.
    -   **Syntax:**
         
        `EXEC sp_spaceused '[object_name]';` 
        
    -   **Explanation:** Helps in monitoring space usage for tables or the entire database.
-   **sp_recompile**
    
    -   **Purpose:** Marks a stored procedure or a trigger to be recompiled the next time it is executed.
    -   **Syntax:**
        
        `EXEC sp_recompile '[object_name]';` 
        
    -   **Explanation:** Useful for ensuring that a stored procedure or trigger is recompiled with the most current execution plan.

### 3. **System Views (`sys` Commands)**

System views provide insights into the metadata, health, and performance of your Azure Synapse Analytics environment.

-   **sys.tables**
    
    -   **Purpose:** Lists all tables within the database.
